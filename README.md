# Happiness-Analysis-Europe

I decided to use Tableau to visualize self-reported happiness data in Europe through key demographic characteristics including country, income, education, minority status, and more. This data was gathered by the European Social Survey (ESS) and the time period of gathering the data was from late 2018 to early 2020. The original dataset is included in this repository, alongside a Jupyter Notebook I used to clean the data and prepare it for visualization within Tableau. I also included the survey documentation, which I used to interpret the dataset.
